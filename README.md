# PROJECT OVERVIEW

FoodEx is a food ordering & delivering platform that reduces carbon emission generated during typical delivery process by encouraging group purchase (food pool) and crowdsourced delivery, which would effectively reduce the delivery effort and cost.

Our team received a lot of useful feedbacks during user testing and CIC sessions since the  last sprint. We will list some of the user feedbacks and our answers below:

F1. Why are you focusing just on Chinese students? How would you plan to generalize it?

Our project started with research targeted on overseas Chinese students, because it’s more familiar to us. And one particular feature of this group is that we all use WeChat for all kinds of purposes, even ordering food. WeChat already has a huge amount of users. Thus, we think there are a lot of potential users for our app, which is an easy start to get into the market.


F2. Instead of accumulating ratings from scratch, Why not display rating from Yelp?

Yelp is absolutely a good place to check rates since it already has its reputation. However, currently, this is not our big concern. We will think about it after our app gets more viable and comprehensive.

This is actually a good suggestion, especially for users who want to view more comprehensive reviews about the restaurant. However, considering the group purchase menu may be different from what the restaurant usually offers, accumulating ratings in our app is more accurate.



F3. The progress bar looks confusing. I think it should be further emphasized.

We have changed our foodpool icon to make it more understandable.

F4. Aren’t you splitting the carbon footprint rather than reduce it?

Our service is one for multiple instead of one for one. One delivery for multiple orders definitely will reduce the carbon emission, and then eventually result in the greater good for environment.

F5. How long would the driver wait for at the pick up location? Is that also determined by the restaurant?

We decided to set up lockers at the pick up station. Drivers can put the food in the locker, and customers can pick up food through QR code. In this way, both drivers and customers don’t need to wait. And we will also have staff  clear the lockers after a period of time and make sure no food left in the lockers. For food left in the lockers, we might collaborate with local organizations to distribute them to vagrants.

F6. Do restaurants have their own driver? Or are you going to provide the drivers?

We will provide drivers to restaurants. Our drivers will pick up food at restaurants at first, and then deliver them to pick up stations.
